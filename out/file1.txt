“So I suppose you’re going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the WestCountry too?” said the Prime Minister, his temper rising with every pace hetook. It was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters
and not to be able to tell the public, almost worse than it being thegovernment’s fault after all.
“That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably.
“Excuse me!” barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamping up anddown. “Trees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries —”
“It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named’sfollowers. And . . . and we suspect giant involvement.”
The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisiblewall. “Whatinvolvement?”
Fudge grimaced. “He used giants last time, when he wanted to go for the
grand effect,” he said. “The Office of Misinformation has been working
around the clock, we’ve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify thememories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened, we’ve got mostof the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creaturesrunning around Somerset, but we can’t find the giant — it’s been a disaster.”
“You don’t say!” said the Prime Minister furiously.
“I won’t deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry,” said Fudge. “Whatwith all that, and then losing Amelia Bones.”
“Losing who?”
“Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Wethink He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named may have murdered her in person,because she was a very gifted witch and — and all the evidence was that sheput up a real fight.”
Fudge cleared his throat and, with an effort, it seemed, stopped spinning hisbowler hat.
“But that murder was in the newspapers,” said the Prime Minister,momentarily diverted from his anger. “Ournewspapers. Amelia Bones . . . it
just said she was a middle-aged woman who lived alone. It was a — a nastykilling, wasn’t it? It’s had rather a lot of publicity. The police are baffled, you
see.”
Fudge sighed. “Well, of course they are,” he said. “Killed in a room thatwas locked from the inside, wasn’t she? We, on the other hand, know exactlywho did it, not that that gets us any further toward catching him. And thenthere was Emmeline Vance, maybe you didn’t hear about that one —”
“Oh yes I did!” said the Prime Minister. “It happened just around the cornerfrom here, as a matter of fact. The papers had a field day with it, ‘breakdown
of law and order in the Prime Minister’s backyard —’”
“And as if all that wasn’t enough,” said Fudge, barely listening to the PrimeMinister, “we’ve got dementors swarming all over the place, attacking peopleleft, right, and center. . . .”
Once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible tothe Prime Minister, but he was wiser now.
“I thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban,” he said cautiously.
“They did,” said Fudge wearily. “But not anymore. They’ve deserted theprison and joined He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I won’t pretend that wasn’t
a blow.”
“But,” said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror, “didn’t youtell me they’re the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people?”
“That’s right. And they’re breeding. That’s what’s causing all this mist.”
The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the nearest chair. The idea ofinvisible creatures swooping through the towns and countryside, spreading
despair and hopelessness in his voters, made him feel quite faint.
“Now see here, Fudge — you’ve got to do something! It’s yourresponsibility as Minister of Magic!”
“My dear Prime Minister, you can’t honestly think I’m still Minister ofMagic after all this? I was sacked three days ago! The whole Wizarding
community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. I’ve never
known them so united in my whole term of office!” said Fudge, with a brave
attempt at a smile.
The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. Despite hisindignation at the position into which he had been placed, he still rather feltfor the shrunken-looking man sitting opposite him.
“I’m very sorry,” he said finally. “If there’s anything I can do?”
“It’s very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is nothing. I was sent heretonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my
successor. I rather thought he’d be here by now, but of course, he’s very busyat the moment, with so much going on.”
Fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing the longcurly silver wig, who was digging in his ear with the point of a quill. CatchingFudge’s eye, the portrait said, “He’ll be here in a moment, he’s just finishingaletter to Dumbledore.”
“I wish him luck,” said Fudge, sounding bitter for the first time. “I’ve beenwriting to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight, but he won’t budge.
If he’d just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still be . . . Well,maybe Scrimgeour will have more success.”
Fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence, but it wasbroken almost immediately by the portrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp,
official voice.
“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a meeting. Urgent. Kindlyrespond immediately. Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic.”
“Yes, yes, fine,” said the Prime Minister distractedly, and he barely flinchedas the flames in the grate turned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a
second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him moments later onto theantique rug.
Fudge got to his feet and, after a moment’s hesitation, the Prime Minister
did the same, watching the new arrival straighten up, dust down his longblack robes, and look around.
The Prime Minister’s first, foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour
looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of gray in his mane oftawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair
of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though hewalked with a slight limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness
and toughness; the Prime Minister thought he understood why the Wizarding
community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangeroustimes.
“How do you do?” said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand.
Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then pulled outawand from under his robes.
“Fudge told you everything?” he asked, striding over to the door andtapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard the lock click.
“Er — yes,” said the Prime Minister. “And if you don’t mind, I’d ratherthat door remained unlocked.”
“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour shortly, “or watched,” he
added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept acrossthem. “Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s get down to business. First of all,we need to discuss your security.”
The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied, “I amperfectly happy with the security I’ve already got, thank you very —”
“Well, we’re not,” Scrimgeour cut in. “It’ll be a poor lookout for theMuggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse. The new
secretary in your outer office —”
“I’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s what you’re
suggesting!” said the Prime Minister hotly. “He’s highly efficient, getsthrough twice the work the rest of them —”
“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, without a flicker ofasmile. “A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for yourprotection.”
“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. “You can’t just putyour people into my office, I decide who works for me —”
“I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?” said Scrimgeour coldly.
“I am — that’s to say, I was —”
“Then there’s no problem, is there?” said Scrimgeour.
“I . . . well, as long as Shacklebolt’s work continues to be . . . er . . .
excellent,” said the Prime Minister lamely, but Scrimgeour barely seemed tohear him.
“Now, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,” he continued. “The
one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck.”
“What about him?” asked the Prime Minister.
“He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse,” saidScrimgeour. “It’s addled his brains, but he could still be dangerous.”
“He’s only quacking!” said the Prime Minister weakly. “Surely a bit ofarest . . . Maybe go easy on the drink . . .”
“A team of Healers from St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and
Injuries are examining him as we speak. So far he has attempted to stranglethree of them,” said Scrimgeour. “I think it best that we remove him fromMuggle society for a while.”
“I . . . well . . . He’ll be all right, won’t he?” said the Prime Ministeranxiously.
Scrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back toward the fireplace.
“Well, that’s really all I had to say. I will keep you posted of developments,Prime Minister — or, at least, I shall probably be too busy to come personally,in which case I shall send Fudge here. He has consented to stay on in an
advisory capacity.”
Fudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he merely looked asthough he had a toothache. Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocketfor the mysterious powder that turned the fire green. The Prime Ministergazed hopelessly at the pair of them for a moment, then the words he hadfought to suppress all evening burst from him at last.
“But for heaven’s sake — you’rewizards! You can domagic! Surely you
can sort out — well —anything!”
Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous lookwith Fudge, who really did manage a smile this time as he said kindly, “Thetrouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister.”
And with that, the two wizards stepped one after the other into the brightgreen fire and vanished.
MCHAPTER TWO
SPINNER’S END
any miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the Prime
Minister’s windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between
overgrown, rubbish-strewn banks. An immense chimney, relic of a disusedmill, reared up, shadowy and ominous. There was no sound apart from thewhisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox thathad slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fish-and-chipwrappings in the tall grass.
But then, with a very faintpop,a slim, hooded figure appeared out of thin
air on the edge of the river. The fox froze, wary eyes fixed upon this strangenew phenomenon. The figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments,then set off with light, quick strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass.
With a second and louderpop,another hooded figure materialized.
“Wait!”
The harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in theundergrowth. It leapt from its hiding place and up the bank. There was a flash
of green light, a yelp, and the fox fell back to the ground, dead.
The second figure turned over the animal with its toe.
“Just a fox,” said a woman’s voice dismissively from under the hood. “I
thought perhaps an Auror — Cissy, wait!”
But her quarry, who had paused and looked back at the flash of light, was
already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down.
“Cissy — Narcissa — listen to me —”
The second woman caught the first and seized her arm, but the otherwrenched it away.
“Go back, Bella!”
“You must listen to me!”
“I’ve listened already. I’ve made my decision. Leave me alone!”
The woman named Narcissa gained the top of the bank, where a line of oldrailings separated the river from a narrow, cobbled street. The other woman,Bella, followed at once. Side by side they stood looking across the road at therows and rows of dilapidated brick houses, their windows dull and blind inthe darkness.
“He lives here?” asked Bella in a voice of contempt. “Here?In this Muggle
dunghill? We must be the first of our kind ever to set foot —”
But Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped through a gap in the rustyrailings and was already hurrying across the road.
“Cissy,wait!”
Bella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw Narcissa dartingthrough an alley between the houses into a second, almost identical street.
Some of the streetlamps were broken; the two women were running betweenpatches of light and deep darkness. The pursuer caught up with her prey justas she turned another corner, this time succeeding in catching hold of her armand swinging her around so that they faced each other.
“Cissy, you must not do this, you can’t trust him —”
“The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn’t he?”
“The Dark Lord is . . . I believe . . . mistaken,” Bella panted, and her eyesgleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they
were indeed alone. “In any case, we were told not to speak of the plan to
anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark Lord’s —”
“Let go, Bella!” snarled Narcissa, and she drew a wand from beneath her
cloak, holding it threateningly in the other’s face. Bella merely laughed.
“Cissy, your own sister? You wouldn’t —”
“There is nothing I wouldn’t do anymore!” Narcissa breathed, a note ofhysteria in her voice, and as she brought down the wand like a knife, therewas another flash of light. Bella let go of her sister’s arm as though burned.
“Narcissa!”
But Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, her pursuer followed
again, keeping her distance now, as they moved deeper into the desertedlabyrinth of brick houses. At last, Narcissa hurried up a street named
Spinner’s End, over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a
giant admonitory finger. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passedboarded and broken windows, until she reached the very last house, whereadim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room.
She had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing under her breath, hadcaught up. Together they stood waiting, panting slightly, breathing in the
smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze. Afterafew seconds, they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack. A
sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them, a man with long black hairparted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes.
Narcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that she seemed to shine inthe darkness; the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the lookof a drowned person.
“Narcissa!” said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that the lightfell upon her and her sister too. “What a pleasant surprise!”
“Severus,” she said in a strained whisper. “May I speak to you? It’surgent.”
“But of course.”
He stood back to allow her to pass him into the house. Her still-hoodedsister followed without invitation.
“Snape,” she said curtly as she passed him.
“Bellatrix,” he replied, his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile
as he closed the door with a snap behind them.
They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room, which had the feeling ofa dark, padded cell. The walls were completely covered in books, most ofthem bound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare sofa, an old armchair,
and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast byacandle-filled lamp hung from the ceiling. The place had an air of neglect, asthough it was not usually inhabited.
Snape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw off her cloak, cast it aside,
and sat down, staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap.Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly. Dark as her sister was fair, withheavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw, she did not take her gaze from Snape as
she moved to stand behind Narcissa.
“So, what can I do for you?” Snape asked, settling himself in the armchairopposite the two sisters.
“We . . . we are alone, aren’t we?” Narcissa asked quietly.
“Yes, of course. Well, Wormtail’s here, but we’re not counting vermin, arewe?”
He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang, ahidden door flew open, revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small manstood frozen.
“As you have clearly realized, Wormtail, we have guests,” said Snapelazily.
The man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps and moved into theroom. He had small, watery eyes, a pointed nose, and wore an unpleasantsimper. His left hand was caressing his right, which looked as though it was
encased in a bright silver glove.
