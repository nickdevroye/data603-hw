“There you go,” said Fred proudly. “Best range of love potions you’ll findanywhere.”
Ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically. “Do they work?” she asked.
“Certainly they work, for up to twenty-four hours at a time depending onthe weight of the boy in question —”
“— and the attractiveness of the girl,” said George, reappearing suddenly attheir side. “But we’re not selling them to our sister,” he added, becomingsuddenly stern, “not when she’s already got about five boys on the go fromwhat we’ve —”
“Whatever you’ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie,” said Ginny calmly,leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf. “What’s this?”
“Guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher,” said Fred. “Excellent on
everything from boils to blackheads, but don’t change the subject. Are you or
are you not currently going out with a boy called Dean Thomas?”
“Yes, I am,” said Ginny. “And last time I looked, he was definitely one boy,not five. What are those?”
She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink andpurple, all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitchedsqueaks.
“Pygmy Puffs,” said George. “Miniature puffskeins, we can’t breed themfast enough. So what about Michael Corner?”
“I dumped him, he was a bad loser,” said Ginny, putting a finger throughthe bars of the cage and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it. “They’rereally cute!”
“They’re fairly cuddly, yes,” conceded Fred. “But you’re moving throughboyfriends a bit fast, aren’t you?”
Ginny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. There was such a Mrs.Weasley-ish glare on her face that Harry was surprised Fred didn’t recoil.
“It’s none of your business. And I’ll thankyou,” she added angrily to Ron,who had just appeared at George’s elbow, laden with merchandise, “not to tell
tales about me to these two!”
“That’s three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,” said Fred, examining themany boxes in Ron’s arms. “Cough up.”
“I’m your brother!”
“And that’s our stuff you’re nicking. Three Galleons, nine Sickles. I’llknock off the Knut.”
“But I haven’t got three Galleons, nine Sickles!”
“You’d better put it back then, and mind you put it on the right shelves.”
Ron dropped several boxes, swore, and made a rude hand gesture at Fredthat was unfortunately spotted by Mrs. Weasley, who had chosen that momentto appear.
“If I see you do that again I’ll jinx your fingers together,” she said sharply.
“Mum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?” said Ginny at once.
“A what?” said Mrs. Weasley warily.
“Look, they’re so sweet. . . .”
Mrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, and Harry, Ron, andHermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window. DracoMalfoy was hurrying up the street alone. As he passed Weasleys’ WizardWheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. Seconds later, he moved beyond the
scope of the window and they lost sight of him.
“Wonder where his mummy is?” said Harry, frowning.
“Given her the slip by the looks of it,” said Ron.
“Why, though?” said Hermione.
Harry said nothing; he was thinking too hard. Narcissa Malfoy would nothave let her precious son out of her sight willingly; Malfoy must have madeareal effort to free himself from her clutches. Harry, knowing and loathingMalfoy, was sure the reason could not be innocent.
He glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were bending over the Pygmy
Puffs. Mr. Weasley was delightedly examining a pack of Muggle markedplaying cards. Fred and George were both helping customers. On the otherside of the glass, Hagrid was standing with his back to them, looking up anddown the street.
“Get under here, quick,” said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of hisbag.
“Oh — I don’t know, Harry,” said Hermione, looking uncertainly towardMrs. Weasley.
“Comeon!” said Ron.
She hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under the Cloak with Harry
and Ron. Nobody noticed them vanish; they were all too interested in Fredand George’s products. Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed their way out ofthe door as quickly as they could, but by the time they gained the street,Malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had.
“He was going in that direction,” murmured Harry as quietly as possible, sothat the humming Hagrid would not hear them. “C’mon.”
They scurried along, peering left and right, through shop windows and
doors, until Hermione pointed ahead.
“That’s him, isn’t it?” she whispered. “Turning left?”
“Big surprise,” whispered Ron.
For Malfoy had glanced around, then slid into Knockturn Alley and out ofsight.
“Quick, or we’ll lose him,” said Harry, speeding up.
“Our feet’ll be seen!” said Hermione anxiously, as the Cloak flapped a little
around their ankles; it was much more difficult hiding all three of them underthe Cloak nowadays.
“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry impatiently. “Just hurry!”
But Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the Dark Arts, lookedcompletely deserted. They peered into windows as they passed, but none ofthe shops seemed to have any customers at all. Harry supposed it was a bit of
a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy Dark artifacts—or at least, to be seen buying them.
Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch.
“Ouch!”
“Shh! Look! He’s in there!” she breathed in Harry’s ear.
They had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley that Harryhad ever visited, Borgin and Burkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister
objects. There in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stoodDraco Malfoy with his back to them, just visible beyond the very same largeblack cabinet in which Harry had once hidden to avoid Malfoy and his father.Judging by the movements of Malfoy’s hands, he was talking animatedly. Theproprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oily-haired, stooping man, stood facingMalfoy. He was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear.
“If only we could hear what they’re saying!” said Hermione.
“We can!” said Ron excitedly. “Hang on — damn —”
He dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbledwith the largest.
“Extendable Ears, look!”
“Fantastic!” said Hermione, as Ron unraveled the long, flesh-coloredstrings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door. “Oh, I hope the
door isn’t Imperturbable —”
“No!” said Ron gleefully. “Listen!”
They put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the
strings, through which Malfoy’s voice could be heard loud and clear, asthough a radio had been turned on.
“. . . you know how to fix it?”
“Possibly,” said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to
commit himself. “I’ll need to see it, though. Why don’t you bring it into the
shop?”
“I can’t,” said Malfoy. “It’s got to stay put. I just need you to tell me how to
do it.”
Harry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously.
“Well, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job, perhapsimpossible. I couldn’t guarantee anything.”
“No?” said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, that Malfoy was
sneering. “Perhaps this will make you more confident.”
He moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet. Harry,Ron, and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight, but allthey could see was Borgin, looking very frightened.
“Tell anyone,” said Malfoy, “and there will be retribution. You know FenrirGreyback? He’s a family friend. He’ll be dropping in from time to time tomake sure you’re giving the problem your full attention.”
“There will be no need for —”
“I’ll decide that,” said Malfoy. “Well, I’d better be off. And don’t forget tokeepthatone safe, I’ll need it.”
“Perhaps you’d like to take it now?”
“No, of course I wouldn’t, you stupid little man, how would I look carryingthat down the street? Just don’t sell it.”
“Of course not . . . sir.”
Borgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had once seen him giveLucius Malfoy.
“Not a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my mother, understand?”
“Naturally, naturally,” murmured Borgin, bowing again.
Next moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy stalked out ofthe shop looking very pleased with himself. He passed so close to Harry, Ron,
and Hermione that they felt the Cloak flutter around their knees again. Insidethe shop, Borgin remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he lookedworried.
“What was that about?” whispered Ron, reeling in the Extendable Ears.
“Dunno,” said Harry, thinking hard. “He wants something mended . . . andhe wants to reserve something in there. . . . Could you see what he pointed atwhen he said ‘that one’?”
“No, he was behind that cabinet —”
“You two stay here,” whispered Hermione.
“What are you — ?”
But Hermione had already ducked out from under the Cloak. She checkedher hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched into the shop, setting thebell tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the doorand passed one of the strings to Harry.
“Hello, horrible morning, isn’t it?” Hermione said brightly to Borgin, who
did not answer, but cast her a suspicious look. Humming cheerily, Hermionestrolled through the jumble of objects on display.
“Is this necklace for sale?” she asked, pausing beside a glass-fronted case.
“If you’ve got one and a half thousand Galleons,” said Mr. Borgin coldly.
“Oh — er — no, I haven’t got quite that much,” said Hermione, walking
on. “And . . . what about this lovely — um — skull?”
“Sixteen Galleons.”
“So it’s for sale, then? It isn’t being . . . kept for anyone?”
Mr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactlywhat Hermione was up to. Apparently Hermione felt she had been rumbledtoo because she suddenly threw caution to the winds.
“The thing is, that — er — boy who was in here just now, Draco Malfoy,well, he’s a friend of mine, and I want to get him a birthday present, but ifhe’s already reserved anything, I obviously don’t want to get him the samething, so . . . um . . .”
It was a pretty lame story in Harry’s opinion, and apparently Borginthought so too.
“Out,” he said sharply. “Get out!”
Hermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the door withBorgin at her heels. As the bell tinkled again, Borgin slammed the doorbehind her and put up the CLOSED sign.
“Ah well,” said Ron, throwing the Cloak back over Hermione. “Worthatry, but you were a bit obvious —”
“Well, next time you can show me how it’s done, Master of Mystery!” she
snapped.
Ron and Hermione bickered all the way back to Weasleys’ WizardWheezes, where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected
around a very anxious-looking Mrs. Weasley and Hagrid, who had clearlynoticed their absence. Once in the shop, Harry whipped off the Invisibility
Cloak, hid it in his bag, and joined in with the other two when they insisted, inanswer to Mrs. Weasley’s accusations, that they had been in the back room all
along, and that she could not have looked properly.
HCHAPTER SEVEN
THE SLUG CLUB
arry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning
of Malfoy’s behavior in Knockturn Alley. What disturbed him mostwas the satisfied look on Malfoy’s face as he had left the shop. Nothing thatmade Malfoy look that happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance,however, neither Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoy’s
activities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it aftera few days.
“Yes, I’ve already agreed it was fishy, Harry,” said Hermione a littleimpatiently. She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and George’s roomwith her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudginglylooked up from her new copy ofAdvanced Rune Translation.“But haven’t we
agreed there could be a lot of explanations?”
“Maybe he’s broken his Hand of Glory,” said Ron vaguely, as he attemptedto straighten his broomstick’s bent tail twigs. “Remember that shriveled-up
arm Malfoy had?”
“But what about when he said, ‘Don’t forget to keepthatone safe’?” askedHarry for the umpteenth time. “That sounded to me like Borgin’s got another
one of the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.”
“You reckon?” said Ron, now trying to scrape some dirt off his broomhandle.
“Yeah, I do,” said Harry. When neither Ron nor Hermione answered, he
said, “Malfoy’s father’s in Azkaban. Don’t you think Malfoy’d like revenge?”
Ron looked up, blinking.
“Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?”
“That’s my point, I don’t know!” said Harry, frustrated. “But he’s up to
something and I think we should take it seriously. His father’s a Death Eater
and —”
Harry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind Hermione, his mouthopen. A startling thought had just occurred to him.
“Harry?” said Hermione in an anxious voice. “What’s wrong?”
“Your scar’s not hurting again, is it?” asked Ron nervously.
“He’s a Death Eater,” said Harry slowly. “He’s replaced his father asaDeath Eater!”
There was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. “Malfoy?He’s sixteen,Harry! You think You-Know-Who would letMalfoyjoin?”
“It seems very unlikely, Harry,” said Hermione in a repressive sort of voice.
“What makes you think — ?”
“In Madam Malkin’s. She didn’t touch him, but he yelled and jerked hisarm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm.He’s been branded with the Dark Mark.”
Ron and Hermione looked at each other.
“Well . . .” said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced.
“I think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry,” said Hermione.
“He showed Borgin something we couldn’t see,” Harry pressed on
stubbornly. “Something that seriously scared Borgin. It was the Mark, I knowit — he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw how seriouslyBorgin took him!”
Ron and Hermione exchanged another look.
“I’m not sure, Harry. . . .”
“Yeah, I still don’t reckon You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join. . . .”
Annoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, Harry snatched up a pile
of filthy Quidditch robes and left the room; Mrs. Weasley had been urgingthem for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment.
On the landing he bumped into Ginny, who was returning to her roomcarrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes.
“I wouldn’t go in the kitchen just now,” she warned him. “There’s a lot ofPhlegm around.”
“I’ll be careful not to slip in it.” Harry smiled.
Sure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur sitting at thekitchen table, in full flow about plans for her wedding to Bill, while Mrs.Weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling sprouts, looking bad-tempered.
“. . . Bill and I ’ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, Ginny and
Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer. I am theenking of dressing zem inpale gold — pink would of course be ’orrible with Ginny’s ’air —”
“Ah, Harry!” said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across Fleur’s monologue.
“Good, I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey toHogwarts tomorrow. We’ve got Ministry cars again, and there will be Aurorswaiting at the station —”
“Is Tonks going to be there?” asked Harry, handing over his Quidditchthings.
“No, I don’t think so, she’s been stationed somewhere else from whatArthur said.”
“She has let ’erself go, zat Tonks,” Fleur mused, examining her own
stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon. “A big mistake if you ask —”
“Yes,thankyou,” said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting across Fleur again.
“You’d better get on, Harry, I want the trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we
don’t have the usual last-minute scramble.”
